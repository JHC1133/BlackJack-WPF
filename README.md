**Project Description**

This project was created as part of an advanced C# and .NET course for my Bachelor's degree.

The assignment was to develop a Blackjack game using event-driven programming, leveraging delegates, events, and lambda expressions. The project follows a layered architecture that incorporates a Data Access Layer (DAL) and an Event Layer (EL), alongside additional class libraries (.DLL files).

For the GUI, I implemented WPF with the MVVM pattern, which separates the UI code from the business logic for modular, maintainable code. I chose MVVM because it enables efficient one-way data binding, enhancing modularity and testability.

Additionally, the project integrates:

- A local database for persistent data storage.
- LINQ expressions for efficient data querying.
- NuGet package management via PowerShell commands.
- Interfaces with Generics to ensure flexible, reusable components across the application.
